     		 	<p><b>1. PROFESSIONALISM:</b> In the present global & local scenario the businesses that do not have a website might not be taken as seriously. Having an online presence suggests professionalism, and also a larger global and local business vision gives a professional image.</p>

     		 	<p><b>2. SEARCH INFORMATION:</b> In the present business scenario the web sites has more or less replaced the yellow pages. So if you want to sale or buy something - one has to search it on the internet. This option allows the buyerss to search quickly and investigate and compare products and services before visiting  the  sales store or an office. Therefore the selling company doesn’t miss  any opportunity of making sales.</p>

     		 	<p><b>3. COST EFFECTIVE MARKETING:</b> Having a website is a cost effective way of advertising and marketing . Normally printing of flyers or brochures  for advertisements and for  short-term promotions are expensive to produce, and also  printing of these materials,has to be done many days or weeksbefore and produced in large volumes, which also contributes to marketing costs. But advertisements published online can be changed frequently and at a relatively minimal cost when compared to other media.</p>

     		 	<p><b>4. MARKET DATABASE:</b> Via web sites one can form a database of the visitors and customers who visit the sites, and then develop and strengthen its relationship with them. The company can proactively target its marketing efforts at specific/identifiable customers. For example one can send  emails to them informing  any news of any future special promotions etc. In turn these site visitors can also provide vital market research like, for example through the web pages they visit, they can provide information about the goods they visit and would like to purchase and also their  comments and feedback.</p>     		
     			

     			<p><b>5. OPPURTUNITY TO EXPAND:</b> An online presence potentially gives a business an opportunity to expand to the global market – its market is not necessarily limited to local customers only. It significantly widens the horizons of operations that are prepared to take advantage of that opportunity.
