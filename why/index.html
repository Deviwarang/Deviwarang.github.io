     		 	<p><b>1. PROFESSIONALISM:</b>If you are a small or medium sized company and wish to have an local and international presence. You should have your own website which suggests professionalism, and also having a larger global and local business vision. Having you own website, is the requirement for every business providing sales of goods or services, these days. One of the successful internet marketing business plan is to have your own website.  Website has become an essential part of every profession, as it makes strong impact and projects your business locally and worldwide. It is a most efficient and cost effective measure to get your potential customers from all over the world through proper internet marketing. Thus irrespective of the size of your organization you need to have your own website for several unavoidable reasons.</p>

     		 	<p><b>2. OVER COME COMPETITION:</b> Needless to mention in every business there is a stiff competition, but we can't stop competition or withdraw from the market. Contrary we need to venture into the competition world with our unique approach and identity to let our potential customers know about our existence and enabling them for comparison. It is only and only the website that could be instrumental in this regard. </p>

     		 	<p><b>3. COST EFFECTIVE MARKETING:</b> Having a website is also a cost effective way of advertising and marketing. You need not make entries in Yellow Pages Books now. Also normally printing of flyers or brochures for advertisements and for short-term promotions are expensive to produce, and printing of these materials, has to be done many days or weeks earlier and produced in large volumes, which also contributes to marketing costs. But advertisements published online can be changed frequently and at a relatively minimal cost when compared to other media.</p>

     		 	<p><b>4. MARKET DATABASE:</b>  Via web sites one can form a massive database i.e. of the visitors and customers who visit their sites, and then develop and strengthen its relationship with them. And with taking the advantage of Databases the company can do research work on their customers and prospective customers. They can proactively target its marketing efforts at specific/identifiable customers.</p>

     			<p><b>5. OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND:</b>  Are you concern about how to explore your business and identity worldwide? An online presence itself gives a business an opportunity to expand to the global market – its market is not necessarily limited to local customers only. It significantly widens the horizons of operations that are prepared to take advantage of that opportunity. A professional web presence builds trust with your visitors, credibility in your industry and increase the value of your products and services.
