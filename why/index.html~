     		 <p><b>1. NECESSARY REQUIREMENT:</b> In the current scenario - if you are a small or medium sized company  and you plan to be successful and profitable then you have to create your own Web Site. Regardless of what your opinion may be, it is a settled fact that the web sites can perform wonders to your business.

     		 	<p><b>2. OVER COME COMPETITION: </b>Needless to mention in every business there is a stiff and fierce competition, but we can't stop participating in the competition or withdraw from the market.  ON the contrary we need to venture into the competition world with our unique approach and identity to let our potential customers know about our existence and enabling them for comparison. It is only and only the website that could be instrumental in this regard. </p>

     		 	<p><b>3. COST EFFECTIVE MARKETING: </b>Having a website is also a cost effective way of advertising and marketing. You need not make entries in Yellow Pages Books now. Also normally printing of flyers or brochures for advertisements and for short-term promotions are expensive to produce, and printing of these materials, has to be done many days or weeks earlier and produced in large volumes, which also contributes to marketing costs. But advertisements published online can be changed frequently and at a relatively minimal cost when compared to other media.</p>
