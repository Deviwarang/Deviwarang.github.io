     		 	<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
     		 	<br> 
     		 <p>Companies always question about getting the website made. Here are some of the most common we receive.</p><br>
     		 <br>
     		<p><b>How much it will cost?</b></p>
     		<p>At the outset we can say that it is very much affordable to small and medium sized companies. It would also depend if any special requirements and the scope and time taken for creating the web site. If one wants to know about it they can send us an email and telling us what exactly you require.</p><br>

     		<p><b>Can we make a website, even though you don’t stay near us?</b></p><p>The answer to this is yes. The communication between us and our customers is mainly via emails or phones. On line tools make it easier to collaborate and work with our customers, with no problems even if they are miles away.
     		</p><br>

     		<p><b>How long it takes for the web sites to be completed & delivered?</b></p>
     		<p>This depends on the scope of your web site projects. A basic small business web site can usually be completed with two to three weeks, provided we have all information content we need from our customers. Generally most of the web sites take about a month for gathering the contents, revisions to the sites and tweaks in the sites.</p><br>

     		<p><b>What kind of technical support do we offer?</b></p>
     		<p>All of our clients get 30 days free technical support on delivering their web sites . In addition to this we offer ongoing support on a hourly rate or through annual support/ maintenance package basis.</p>
